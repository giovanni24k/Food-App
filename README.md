# Food-App

This project contains a Web App where it is possible to insert any address or city name and it will return all the restaurants near that position. It's possible to filter the restaurants by category (pizza, burgers, ecc...)
Every restaurant has a page-detail where it can be possible to have a look at all the recipes for that restaurant and add them to a cart. You must register a new user and log in to use this app.

The project contains two sublfolders: FE and BE
The Front End side is made with React and React Redux for state management.
The Back End side is made with Node.js, Express and MongoDB

THe API's used are "YELP" (for get restaurants by the address) and "Edamam Food and Grocery Database" (for get all the recipes by the category of the restaurant)

Enjoy!
